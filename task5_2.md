## A discussion on chart component improvements and extensions

### For the scatter chart component
we can set the interval (hour in the original case) to be a dynamic value, which can help the users get a more accurate average value than the current setting.

### For the line chart component

The readings can be enhanced with "statistics" by collecting and processing them to come up with some general, most commonly searched values such as the difference between the highest reading and the lowest. These values would help users gather necessary data without the need of an extra tool.
The linechart itself could also be extended with the inclusion of other values (24 hours statistics on multiple pollutants), not just limited to 1 chart 1 pollutants. This could help compare the readings between each pollutants during the 24-hour period.
